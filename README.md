uptest
======

uptest.sh will ping google.com every 15 seconds (or user-defined interval), and display the results. Tested on Ubuntu.

upanalyze.pl will look at a log from uptest.sh and summarize the % of uptime per hour graphically.

Find the instructions for using each script by running it with the option -h.
